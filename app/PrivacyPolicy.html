<p>If the user never configures the app to connect to a caltopo map, their device location
is never used or shared in any way.</p>
<p>If the user configures the app to connect to a Caltopo map via their
<a href="https://training.caltopo.com/all_users/team-accounts/teamapi">Teams Account</a>,
this app will collect the device's location and place a marker on the map representing the
location of this device.   The device location is not saved or published anywhere else.</p>

<p> The Caltopo Teams credentials are entered by loading from a .json file (described in this
    distribution's README.md file which is referenced within the application's "Help" menu item).
    After loading, the credentials and other app configuration parameters are saved locally to
    the app's filesystem which is encrypted and backed-up by google and the Android Operating System.</p>

<p> If the user ever wants to remove/reset this information they can delete the applications
    data (under App settings) or simply uninstall the app.</p>
